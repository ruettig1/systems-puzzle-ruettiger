1. Saw "err_connection_refused" error when trying to load page. Noticed in
docker-compose.yml that port declaration for nginx was backwards.
Switched to 8080:80.
2. Received "502 Bad Gateway Error" - noticed port is declared in flaskapp.conf
but nothing in app.py referred to port 5001. Added port in app.run method call
3. Ran docker-compose logs to see logs up until this point. Saw that debug mode
was not on for flask, added that into app.run method in app.py. Used these logs
to add print statements for better understanding.
4. When an item is added to the database and the success page is brought up,
the results aren't rendering. Printed out the results list and saw that it was
a list of objects. Created loop to go through qry.all() to append name of each
items to results list and then returned that list.
